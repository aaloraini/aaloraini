Electrical & Electronics Engineering Student

Hi, welcome to my GitHub 👋

I'm an EEE student.  
This is where I share projects that I build while learning.
both for my studies and as personal hobby work.

Here, you'll mostly find:

- Small engineering-related software tools
- Digital logic or system design experiments
- Hobby iOS / macOS apps
- Hardware-based student projects
- Utility tools for university use

Most of the repositories here are learning projects where I try to understand how systems actually work by building them.

Thanks for stopping by.
